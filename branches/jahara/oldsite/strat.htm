            <p><b>Light Shields</b><br>
              There are few light shields that load on Arda. The light shields 
              are the Cardolan, Arthedain, and Gilded. The shields are not that 
              heavy, they weigh about 1/2 as much as normal shields that give 
              the same amount of parry bonus. The shields go up in weight as their 
              pb goes up too.</p>

              <b>Shield of Cardolan / Malardil </b><br>
              The Shield of Cardolan loads on Malardil. His castle loads north 
              west of Tharbad and can be reached by spamming north-west from the 
              Tharbad northgate until you reach a few forest spiders. From there 
              you have to head south into a random forest with random exits, eventually 
              you'll get to the castle by going southward. As you pass by a well 
              and go eastward you should reach the Castle Gate, from there you 
              need to get a key which loads on one of the rogues in the outpost 
              south of the gate. Once inside you should kill the guards first. 
              Try to avoid going up until the guards are dead; Malardil is up 
              there. Once all the guards have been killed it is wise to get Malardil 
              to track you outside into the forest. The randoms inside the forest 
              will prevent him from getting to you and you can kill his followers 
              one by one.<br>
              <i>Requirements:</i> legend -- hero thief -- 3+ level 16s.<br>
              <i></i><i>Mobs:</i> Malardil, Gypsy, 8 guards, 4 rogues<br>
              <i>Loads</i>: thin metal breastplates, russet cloak, falchions, 
              full metal shields, shield of cardolan, full leather set, shiny 
              dagger, lute, set of lock picks.</p>
            <p><b>Shield of Arthedain / Bill Ferny<br>
              </b> To get to the shack you'll have to go to the west side of the 
              Midgewater Marshes and look for the &quot;End of the Path&quot;. 
              From there you'll have to enter the marsh to get to his shack by 
              going 2n, 2e, open bush, d, e. By heading one more east it'll bring 
              you to 3 rogues, kill them. You should now be next to a bonfire 
              with a door to the east, this leads into the shack where you'll 
              find 2 thugs, a robber, and Bill Ferny himself. Kill Bill Ferny 
              first and then flee out. Loot the &quot;root&quot; from his corpse, 
              this is the key to the &quot;wall&quot; to the east. You have the 
              choice of either killing the rest of the mobs or just going on through 
              the wall by unlocking and opening. Once Bill Ferny is dead the thugs 
              are free to move around and will come out of the shack eventually. 
              If you want to do the mobs then kill the thugs when the exit before 
              entering, thus preventing yourself have to buff all 3 of his underlings 
              at once; once done with the thugs kill the robber. After you have 
              entered the room east of the wall you'll find a few silver pennies 
              and some beer barrels. From here you need a person with a very good 
              picking skill 80%+ or a warrior with bash/cleric with breakdoor. 
              You have to pick/bash open the &quot;floorboards&quot;. Once that 
              is completed you can go 1d and kill 2 mastiffs (dogs). If you have 
              luck the shields should load on the ground.<br>
              <i>Requirements:</i> level 12 warrior, blinder -- hero+ -- 4+ level 
              12s<br>
              <i></i><i></i><i>Mobs:</i> Bill Ferny, 3 ruffians, 2 thugs, a robber, 
              2 mastiffs.<br>
              <i>Loads:</i> 3 shortswords, morningstar, cudgel, rapier, large 
              metal full shield, small wooden target shield, large metal shield, 
              full metal shield, cassok, forest green cloak, shield of arthedain.</p>
            <p><b>Gilded round shield / Galerel the Ghost<br>
              </b>The gilded round shield loads on a ghost in a ruined mansion 
              north of the &quot;Old East Road by a Rock&quot;, some east of Bree. 
              For lowbies/solo character with no good bash/picking skills it is 
              easier to get the key. There are two ways to do this. There is also 
              a stove that loads 5 pieces of smoked, cured meat; from the frontdoor 
              you go north, west, north. Oh, and don't forget to sign the guestbook 
              1n of the frontdoor too!</p>
            <p><i>1) Key (lowbies, you need at least one practice in pick/lockpicks)</i><br>
              The &quot;tinted brass key&quot; loads on a black crow near the 
              Old Wight; from the oer rock go 3e, s and around this area is where 
              the black crow moves around. Move around here south of the road 
              until you find the black crow. Its hard to kill it since it has 
              a max wimpy flee, so arrows/magic are a good way to get rid of it. 
              Once it is dead you want to loot the key from it's body. Return 
              to the oer rock. From here you want to go e, 4n, open bushwall, 
              w. Once inside the bushwall you have to pick open the frontdoor. 
              From there go n, u. You should be on the &quot;Creaking Balcony&quot; 
              and then use the key to unlock the door north, go north. There is 
              some special mudlle here that makes you &quot;winch&quot; a basket 
              up to the balcony. This basket leads down to Galerel. When you winch 
              you automatically sit down and have to stand up once the basket 
              reaches the balcony. Only one person can enter the basket at a time. 
              Immediately after the basket reaches the top you want to go one 
              north. Turn climb on if you want to flee from Galerel, otherwise 
              leave it off. Wait until the basket drifts down to Galerel's platform, 
              then you can step off by going down. Here you will meet Galerel 
              the ghost. If you have a group and you want to get them to come, 
              you should flee/go any direction and pick/open the oakdoor, go south, 
              open the tapestry, south, up, north. You are at the balcony once 
              again and can now bring your friends directly to Galerel by going 
              backwards (d, n, n, turn climb on, u).</p>
            <p><i>2) No Key (good +80% pick, bash, break door)</i><br>
              Go to the oer rock. From there go e, 4n, open bushwall, w. Once 
              inside the bushwall you have to pick open the frontdoor. Then go 
              north, open tapestry, n, pick oakdoor, open oakdoor, turn climb 
              on, up. Kill Galarel and loot.</p>
